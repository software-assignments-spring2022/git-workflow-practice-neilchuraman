# Complexity is killing software developers
#Software Engineers Backbone Of Space Tech

##Summary
I think it is interesting that developers and software engineers write the software that does the calculations to make sure that rockets will reach their target and that sattelites don't collide
with each other, however, many don't consider those developers as "rocket scientists". As satellite internet becomes more common, there are more satellites in the sky and also these satellites
have to orbit lower. As a result of this, it makes it more likely that there will be collisions. It is really interesting that the developers at StarLink were able to write software to get
these sattelites to pilot themselves. I also find it interesting that software engineers at companies like StarLink and SpaceX have a completely different approach than traditional software engineers.
At companies like Google they allow their software to fail at times in order to learn from the failure. However, with SpaceTech companies it is entirely possible that lives will be lost if
there is a failure with their software. For example, there are strenous criteria and testing that needs to be done before they can merge with the production branch or the main branch.
